This repo `rnaseqtools` provides a set of tools to process transcripts (mainly in
`gtf` format).  To compile these tools, you first need to 
download the source code from [here](https://github.com/Kingsford-Group/rnaseqtools/releases/download/v1.0.0/rnaseqtools-1.0.tar.gz),
then use the following commands to compile:
```
./configure --prefix=/path/to/your/install/folder
make
make install
```
